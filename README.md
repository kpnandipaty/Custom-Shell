You must do both of these steps before adding any deliverables. Maintainer: Manage -> Members -> Invite members -> search for and select @healygr -> set Select Maximum role to maintainer -> click Invite; Private: Settings -> General -> Visibility, project features, permissions -> Project visibility = private.
